ðŸ“– Relationship Explanation:
- Each Author can have many Books (one-to-many).
- The AuthorSerializer uses the nested BookSerializer to automatically include
  details of all books related to that author.
- Example output:
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "George Orwell",
    "books": [
        {"id": 1, "title": "1984", "publication_year": 1949, "author": 1},
        {"id": 2, "title": "Animal Farm", "publication_year": 1945, "author": 1}
    ]
